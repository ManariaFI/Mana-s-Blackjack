# Mana-s-Blackjack
Blackjack Game in work of progress from Manaria

Heyas! If you're reading this, I'm assuming you either know me personally or somehow have learned about my coding journey. Nice to meet you anyways!

This project has originally been used Scrimba's JavaScript course materials as basis, and I have been improving the code myself a lot. Regardless, I'm super thankful for them
about teaching me how to code, and understand lot of concepts about the variables. In future I have plan to improve my code further and add some extra functions. Couple to
mention, I want to have actual cards instead of just card visuals. In that regard would be interested to add some suits as well into the game! Another function I would love to 
add in future is betting custom amounts of chips, with proper win and lose screens (as you know, money doesn't grow on trees and wanting people having a chance to "win" the 
game for real!

I'm hoping you having very great day; if you are insterested about my thoughts, you can find me from Twitter/X as ManariaFGC or in BlueSky as Manaria :3 If having improvement 
suggestions or tips I'm always on ears.

Regards,
Mana
